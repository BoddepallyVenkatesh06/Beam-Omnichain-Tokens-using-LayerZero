Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused.

This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

Default is set to 10,000 token ids\n w/ 2500 tokens on 4 chains. Uses uint[](40) to keep track of token ids on current chain. Each uint in the array uses\n 250 bits of its allotted 256 bits to represent token ids. If the bit is set to 1 then that token id can be minted.\n Token Ids are defined by where they are in the tokenIds array.\n For example:\n      [0]: 1-250,\n      [1]: 251-500,\n      [2]: 501-750,\n      ... ,\n      [40]: 9751-10000\n\nExample using 8 bits to represent token distribution:\n\n             Chain A | Chain B\ntokenIds[0]: 0xff    | 0x0\ntokenIds[1]: 0x0     | 0xff\n\nBinary equivalent:\n\n              Chain A   |  Chain B\ntokenIds[0]: 1111 1111  | 0000 0000\ntokenIds[1]: 0000 0000  | 1111 1111\n\nIn this scenario Chain A owns tokenIds: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and Chain B owns tokenIds: 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n\nChain A wants to send over 2 Token Ids to Chain B\n\n             Chain A | Chain B\ntokenIds[0]: 0x3f    | 0xc0\ntokenIds[1]: 0x0     | 0xff\n\nBinary equivalent:\n\n              Chain A   |  Chain B\ntokenIds[0]: 0011 1111  | 1100 0000\ntokenIds[1]: 0000 0000  | 1111 1111\n\nNow Chain A owns tokenIds: 3,4,5,6,7,8 and Chain B owns tokenIds: 1,2,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n**/\ncontract DistributeONFT721 is ONFT721 {\n\n    uint16 public constant FUNCTION_TYPE_DISTRIBUTE = 2;\n    // Each uint in the array uses 250 bits of its allotted 256 bits to represent token ids.\n    uint16 public constant NUM_TOKENS_PER_INDEX = 250;\n    uint16 public constant MAX_TOKENS_PER_INDEX = 256;\n\n    uint public distributeBaseDstGas = 50000;\n    uint public distributeGasPerIdx = 25000;\n\n    event Distribute(uint16 indexed _srcChainId, TokenDistribute[] tokenDistribute);\n    event ReceiveDistribute(uint16 indexed _srcChainId, bytes indexed _srcAddress, TokenDistribute[] tokenDistribute);\n    event SetDistributeBaseDstGas(uint _distributeBaseDstGas);\n    event SetDistributeGasPerIdx(uint _distributeGasPerIdx);\n\n    struct TokenDistribute {\n        uint index;\n        uint value;\n    }\n\n    uint[] public tokenIds = new uint[](40);\n\n    /// @notice Constructor for the DistributeONFT721\n    /// @param _name the name of the token\n    /// @param _symbol the token symbol\n    /// @param _layerZeroEndpoint handles message transmission across chains\n    /// @param _indexArray to set to all ones representing token ids available to mint\n    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint256 _minGasToTransfer, address _layerZeroEndpoint, uint[] memory _indexArray, uint[] memory _valueArray) ONFT721(_name, _symbol, _minGasToTransfer, _layerZeroEndpoint){\n        uint _indexArrayLength = _indexArray.length;\n        require(_indexArrayLength == _valueArray.length, \"_indexArray and _valueArray must be same length\");\n        for(uint i;
